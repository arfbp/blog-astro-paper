```
3. Through IT Support (OTP Required)
```

If you are unable to reset the password using method above, you can contact the IT team:  
1. Request password reset assistance from IT.  
2. IT will require an **OTP** (One-Time Password), which you can retrieve from your **WeCom** chat.  
3. Provide the OTP to IT so they can complete the reset.

## Reminder
- Renew your password **before** the 120-day period ends.  
- Use a **strong** and **unique** password.  
- Never share your password with anyone.
